## Basics

You may open the console by pressing the `~` key, if you do not have this key you can change the key in the option. Please refer to the virtual key codes to know what number to use.

## Lua

The console is using Lua, you may want to look up how to use it before proceeding.

### Specificity

To call an internal script function, just prefix the function you want to call with `Game.`.

For example if one wants to call `AddToInventory` they would call `Game.AddToInventory("ItemName", 1)`

There are many script functions, not all are known, if a list were to appear I will add it here.

See [Tutorial](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/wiki/Script-tutorial) for more information.
